Vectron is an application to create, load and edit maps for Armagetron Advanced, an open source 3D videogame based on the lightcycle sequence from the movie Tron.

The project started in September 2009. It was written in C++ under Linux, using GTK2, Cairo and libxml++. Since the beginning, it was intended to be platform independent.<br>
Due to lack of programming skills and time, Vectron never became usable and the project had been abandoned.<br>
<br>
About a year later I've started Vectron from scratch, using Adobe Flash CS3 and Action Script 3.<br>
Many reasons made me switch technology:<br>
- I'm used with flash because of my job.<br>
- The application is platform independent.<br>
- The user doesn't need to install anything because he just needs a browser with flash player installed.<br>
- Flash is a very powerful and flexible platform when it comes to build a GUI.<br>
- Lately (from version 9) the flash player has hugely improved its performances.<br>
- As3 is a standard-compliant oop language. Being familiar with C++ and Javascript, I had no problems learning it.<br>
